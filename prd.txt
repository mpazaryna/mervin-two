# Product Requirements Document: MCP Learning Server

## Overview
A simple Python-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to help users learn MCP fundamentals through hands-on implementation and experimentation.

## Product Goals
- Provide a minimal, educational MCP server implementation in Python, use venv to manage dependencies
- Demonstrate core MCP concepts including tools, resources, and prompts
- Enable rapid prototyping and learning of MCP patterns
- Serve as a foundation for building more complex MCP applications

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Developers learning Model Context Protocol
- **Secondary**: AI application builders exploring MCP integration
- **Tertiary**: Students and educators in AI/LLM courses

## Core Features

### 1. Basic MCP Server Framework
**Priority**: P0
- Implement MCP protocol handlers for initialization, tools, resources, and prompts
- Support standard MCP message types (ping, list_tools, call_tool, etc.)
- Handle client connections via stdio transport
- Provide clear error handling and logging

### 2. Educational Tool Examples
**Priority**: P0
- **Calculator tool**: Basic arithmetic operations to demonstrate tool calling
- **File reader tool**: Read local text files to show resource access patterns
- **Echo tool**: Simple input/output demonstration
- **Time tool**: Current timestamp utility

### 3. Sample Resources
**Priority**: P1
- **Learning materials**: Static educational content about MCP
- **Example configurations**: Sample MCP client configurations
- **Documentation links**: Curated learning resources

### 4. Interactive Prompts
**Priority**: P1
- **MCP explainer**: Generate explanations of MCP concepts
- **Code examples**: Provide MCP implementation examples
- **Best practices**: Share MCP development guidelines

### 5. Development Features
**Priority**: P2
- Hot reload capability for rapid development
- Debug mode with verbose logging
- Configuration file support
- Basic performance metrics

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external libraries (prefer standard library)
- **Transport**: stdio (with potential for HTTP/WebSocket expansion)
- **Protocol**: MCP specification compliance

### Performance
- Handle 10+ concurrent tool calls
- Sub-100ms response time for simple operations
- Memory usage under 50MB baseline

### Compatibility
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Compatible with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
- Follow MCP specification version 1.0

## User Stories

### Learning Flow
1. **As a developer**, I want to run a simple MCP server so I can understand the basic protocol flow
2. **As a learner**, I want to call tools from Claude to see how MCP enables AI-tool integration
3. **As a student**, I want to modify the server code to experiment with custom tools
4. **As an educator**, I want clear examples to demonstrate MCP concepts in class

### Development Flow
1. **As a developer**, I want to add new tools easily so I can extend functionality
2. **As a builder**, I want to see debug output so I can troubleshoot MCP interactions
3. **As a contributor**, I want good code structure so I can understand and modify the implementation

## Success Metrics

### Learning Objectives
- Users can successfully connect Claude to the MCP server within 5 minutes
- Users can call at least 3 different tools and understand the request/response flow
- Users can modify or add a simple tool within 15 minutes of setup

### Technical Metrics
- Zero-crash server operation for basic use cases
- 100% MCP protocol compliance for implemented features
- Clear error messages for common mistakes

## Out of Scope (V1)
- Advanced authentication/security features
- Database integrations
- Complex business logic tools
- Production-grade monitoring
- Multi-client session management
- GUI interface

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Server (Week 1)
- Basic MCP protocol implementation
- stdio transport layer
- Simple calculator and echo tools
- Basic error handling

### Phase 2: Educational Features (Week 2)
- File reading capabilities
- Learning resource endpoints
- Documentation and examples
- Debug logging

### Phase 3: Polish & Documentation (Week 3)
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Code comments and docstrings
- Example client configurations
- Troubleshooting guide

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **MCP spec complexity**: Start with minimal implementation, expand gradually
- **Transport reliability**: Use well-tested stdio patterns, add reconnection logic
- **Cross-platform issues**: Test on all major platforms early

### User Experience Risks
- **Setup complexity**: Provide clear installation scripts and documentation
- **Learning curve**: Include step-by-step tutorials and common examples
- **Debug difficulty**: Implement comprehensive logging and error messages
